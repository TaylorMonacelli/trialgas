I'm trying to do something I may or may not be able to do.

I want to support the ability to enter values that make sense to them.

E.g.

allocations: { allocation_one: "20%"}

where this will automatically get 20% of a value defined in the scope.

The scalar definition here works, but I'm having trouble adding
context for the definition to be useful without defining a tailor made
version of that definition for each case.

I've outlined the approach so far here:
https://cuelang.org/play/?id=dTwQshUzTTK#cue@export@cue along with
some comments on what I'm trying to do.

It's all a bit odd, but potentially very cool.
